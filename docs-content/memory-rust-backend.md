# Rust Memory Backend

Stella keeps the existing `memory/` Python engine as the default and fallback.
The optional Rust distribution is installed independently as
`stella-memory-rust`; it uses the `memory_rust` namespace and targets memory
schema 14 with backend API version 1.

## Runtime Modes

Set `MEMORY_BACKEND` before starting Stella:

- `python`: existing Python implementation, the default.
- `rust`: use the native Rust retrieval backend; incompatibility or runtime
  errors are surfaced.
- `auto`: use Rust when available and compatible, then fall back to Python.
- `shadow`: run Rust read-only beside Python, record parity diagnostics, and
  return the Python result. Rust performs no write or post-commit side effect.
- `strict`: require the Rust backend and surface load or contract failures.

For compatibility with earlier rollout scripts, `MEMORY_RUST_SHADOW=true`
selects `shadow` and `MEMORY_RUST_STRICT=true` selects `strict` when
`MEMORY_BACKEND` is unset. If both flags are enabled, strict wins. An explicit
`MEMORY_BACKEND` value always takes precedence.

The first rollout keeps `python` as the recommended setting. Returning to the
Python engine is an environment-only change:

```text
MEMORY_BACKEND=python
```

Rust does not own embedding HTTP, LLM consolidation, schema migration,
Python async locks, scheduler work, cache invalidation, or compressor
side effects.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Rust distribution | Backend API | Memory schema | Python |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `stella-memory-rust 0.1.x` | 1 | 14 | 3.10+ (`abi3`) |

The native loader rejects API or schema mismatches before selecting Rust. The
main Stella package keeps the Python engine and does not require this
distribution.

## Release Assets

The Rust engine ships through three of the six Windows product assets, published
in the same `vX.Y.Z` GitHub Release as the Python products:

```text
Stella-OneClick-Rust-vX.Y.Z-windows-amd64.exe           # installer prepares the engine during installation
Stella-OneClick-Rust-Offline-vX.Y.Z-windows-amd64.exe   # offline installer, same engine, fully bundled payload
Stella-Standalone-Rust-vX.Y.Z-windows-amd64.zip         # Stella-only archive bundling the wheel
```

The Standalone-Rust archive includes the normal `start.bat` bootstrap and one
bundled `stella-memory-rust` wheel under `wheels/`. Running `start.bat` (or
`Stella.exe`) follows the same first-run setup as the Python archive, then
installs the local wheel into the application directory without downloading
it and selects `MEMORY_BACKEND=rust`. The OneClick-Rust installer performs the
same preparation during the installation stage; the plain Python products have
no `wheels/` directory and keep the Python engine. Installing beside the bundled
`memory_rust` package keeps the native extension importable from the embedded
Python runtime. `VERSION.txt` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` describe the native engine
payload. The wheel package version remains independent of the Stella
application version, while the asset filename always uses the exact main
Release tag.
